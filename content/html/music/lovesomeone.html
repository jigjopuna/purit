Love is a funny thing<br />
Whenever I give it – it comes back to me<br />
And it’s wonderful to be giving with my whole heart<br />
As my heart receives your love<br />

Oh, ain’t it nice this life we got each other<br />
I am right beside you<br />
More than just a partner or a lover,<br />
I’m your friend<br />
<br />
When you love someone<br />
Your heartbeat beats so loud<br />
When you love someone<br />
Your feet can’t feel the ground<br />
Shining stars all seem to congregate around your face<br />
When you love someone<br />
It comes back to you<br />
<br />
And love is a funny thing<br />
It’s making my blood flow with energy<br />
And it’s like an awakened dream<br />
Oh what I’ve been wishing for is happening<br />
And it’s right on time<br />
<br />
Oh ain’t it nice tonight we got each other<br />
I am right beside you<br />
More than just a partner or a lover<br />
I’m your friend<br />
<br />
When you love someone<br />
Your heartbeat beats so loud<br />
When you love someone<br />
Your feet can’t feel the ground<br />
Shining stars all seem to congregate around your face<br />
When you love someone<br />
<br />
When you love someone<br />
<br />
I gonna give myself to love tonight<br />
I'll lift you up to touch the moonlight<br />
And we will savor every second we<br />
Spend together you and I will<br />
<br />
We're gonna give ourselves to love tonight<br />
Lifting up to touch the starlight<br />
And we will savor every second we<br />
Suspend together you and I will<br />
You and I will, you and I will<br />
<br />
When you love someone<br />
Your heartbeat beats so loud<br />
When you love someone<br />
Your feet can’t feel the ground<br />
Shining stars all seem to congregate<br />
Around your face when you love someone<br />
When you love someone<br />
It comes back to you<br />
