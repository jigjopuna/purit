        I miss taste of the sweet life<br/> 
I miss the conversation<br/> 
I’m searching for a song tonight<br/> 
I’m changing all of the stations<br/> 
I like to think that, we had it all<br/> 
We drew a map to a better place<br/> 
But on that road I took a fall<br/> 
Oh baby why did you run away?<br/> 

I was there for you<br/> 
In your darkest times<br/> <br/> 
I was there for you<br/> 
In your darkest nights<br/> 
<br/> 
But I wonder where were you<br/> 
When I was at my worst<br/> 
Down on my knees<br/> 
And you said you had my back<br/> 
So I wonder where were you<br/> 
All the roads you took came back to me<br/> 
So I’m following the map that leads to you<br/> 
The map that leads to you<br/> 
Ain't nothing I can do<br/> 
The map that leads to you<br/> 
Following, following, following to you<br/> 
The map that leads to you<br/> 
Ain't nothing I can do<br/> 
The map that leads to you<br/> 
Following, following, following<br/> 

<br/>
I hear your voice in my sleep at night<br/> 
Hard to resist temptation<br/> 
Cause all these strangers come over me<br/> 
Now I can’t get over you<br/> 
No I just can’t get over you<br/> 

I was there for you<br/> 
In your darkest times<br/> 
I was there for you<br/> 
In your darkest nights<br/> 

But I wonder where were you<br/> 
When I was at my worst<br/> 
Down on my knees<br/> 
And you said you had my back<br/> 
So I wonder where were you<br/> 
All the roads you took came back to me<br/> <br/> 
So I’m following the map that leads to you<br/> 
The map that leads to you<br/> 
Ain't nothing I can do<br/> 
The map that leads to you<br/> 
Following, following, following to you<br/> 
The map that leads to you<br/> 
Ain't nothing I can do<br/> 
The map that leads to you<br/> 

Oh oh oh<br/> 
Oh oh oh<br/> 
Yeah yeah yeah<br/> 
Oh oh<br/> 
<br/> 
Oh I was there for you<br/> 
Oh In you darkest times<br/> 
Oh I was there for you<br/> 
Oh In your darkest nights<br/> 

Oh I was there for you<br/> <br/> 
Oh In you darkest times<br/> 
Oh I was there for you<br/> 
Oh In your darkest nights<br/> 

But I wonder where were you<br/> 
When I was at my worst<br/> 
Down on my knees<br/> 
And you said you had my back<br/> 
So I wonder where were you<br/>
