     Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?<br />
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?<br />
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing<br />
Just cause everybody doing what they all do<br />
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow<br />
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home<br /><br />

So am I wrong?<br />
For thinking that we could be something for real?<br />
Now am I wrong?<br />
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?<br />
But that's just how I feel,<br />
That's just how I feel<br />
That's just how I feel<br />
Trying to reach the things that I can't see<br /><br />

Am I tripping for having a vision?<br />
My prediction: I'ma be on the top of the world<br />
Walk your walk and don't look back, always do what you decide<br />
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel<br />
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no<br />
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel<br />
<br />
Am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)<br />
For thinking that we could be something for real?<br />
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)<br />
Now am I wrong?<br />
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?<br />
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)<br />
But that's just how I feel,<br />
That's just how I feel<br />
That's just how I feel<br />
Trying to reach the things that I can't see<br />
<br />
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong<br />
I don't wanna be right, right<br />
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong<br />
I don't wanna be right<br />
