     Saturday morning jumped out of bed<br />
And put on my best suit<br />
Got in my car and raced like a jet<br />
All the way to you<br />
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand<br />
To ask you a question<br />
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah<br />
<br />
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?<br />
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know<br />
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die<br />
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'<br />
<br />
Why you gotta be so rude?<br />
Don't you know I'm human too?<br />
Why you gotta be so rude?<br />
I'm gonna marry her anyway<br />
<br />
Marry that girl<br />
Marry her anyway<br />
Marry that girl<br />
Yeah, no matter what you say<br />
Marry that girl<br />
And we'll be a family<br />
Why you gotta be so<br />
Rude<br />
<br />
I hate to do this, you leave no choice<br />
Can't live without her<br />
Love me or hate me we will be boys<br />
Standing at that altar<br />
Or we will run away<br />
To another galaxy, you know<br />
You know she's in love with me<br />
She will go anywhere I go<br />

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?<br />
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know<br />
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die<br />
Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still 'No"<br />

Why you gotta be so rude?<br />
Don't you know I'm human too?<br />
Why you gotta be so rude?<br />
I'm gonna marry her anyway<br />

Marry that girl<br />
Marry her anyway<br />
Marry that girl<br />
No matter what you say<br />
Marry that girl<br />
And we'll be a family<br />
Why you gotta be so<br />
Rude<br />
Rude<br />

Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?<br />
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know<br />
You say, I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die<br />
Tough luck, my friend, but 'No' still means 'No'!<br />

Why you gotta be so rude?<br />
Don't you know I'm human too?<br />
Why you gotta be so rude?<br />
I'm gonna marry her anyway<br />

Marry that girl<br />
Marry her anyway<br />
Marry that girl<br />
No matter what you say<br />
Marry that girl<br />
And we'll be a family<br />
Why you gotta be so<br /><br />
Rude<br />
